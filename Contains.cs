You are filtering employees whose Sid is in bankerSids and IsActive is false. To achieve this with a join:

csharp
Copy code
var data = await (from emp in IDBContext.Employees
                  join sid in bankerSids
                  on emp.Sid.ToLower() equals sid.ToLower()
                  where emp.IsActive == false
                  select emp).ToListAsync();
Second Query
You are filtering employees whose Sid is not in bankerSids and IsActive is true. Using join to exclude the matches:

csharp
Copy code
var data2 = await (from emp in IDBContext.Employees
                   join sid in bankerSids
                   on emp.Sid.ToLower() equals sid.ToLower() into empSidGroup
                   from sid in empSidGroup.DefaultIfEmpty()
                   where sid == null && emp.IsActive == true
                   select emp).ToListAsync();
Explanation:
First Query: It performs an inner join between the Employees table and bankerSids, filtering by employees who match the Sid in bankerSids and have IsActive set to false.
Second Query: It uses a left join and checks for null values (i.e., Sid not in bankerSids), then filters by IsActive == true.
This should help avoid the Contains issue and convert it to join logic.





await IDBContext.Employees
    .Where(emp => !bankerSids.Any(sid => sid.ToLower() == emp.Sid.ToLower()) && emp.IsActive == true)
    .ExecuteUpdateAsync(setters => setters
        .SetProperty(emp => emp.IsActive, emp => false)  // Example: Updating IsActive to false
        .SetProperty(emp => emp.Modified, date)          // Example: Updating Modified date
    );



await IDBContext.Employees
    .Where(emp => bankerSids.Any(sid => sid.ToLower() == emp.Sid.ToLower()) && emp.IsActive == false)
    .ExecuteUpdateAsync(setters => setters
        .SetProperty(emp => emp.IsActive, emp => true)  // Example: Updating IsActive to true
        .SetProperty(emp => emp.Modified, date)         // Example: Updating Modified date
    );



1. Query for Sid IN bankerSids (Update Inactive to Active):
This query updates employees whose Sid exists in the bankerSids list and are currently inactive (IsActive == false).

csharp
Copy code
await IDBContext.Employees
    .Join(bankerSids, 
        emp => emp.Sid.ToLower(), 
        sid => sid.ToLower(),
        (emp, sid) => emp)
    .Where(emp => emp.IsActive == false)
    .ExecuteUpdateAsync(setters => setters
        .SetProperty(emp => emp.IsActive, emp => true)  // Update IsActive to true
        .SetProperty(emp => emp.Modified, date)         // Update Modified date
    );
Explanation:
Join(): Performs an inner join between Employees and bankerSids, matching employees whose Sid is in bankerSids.
Where(): Filters inactive employees (IsActive == false).
ExecuteUpdateAsync(): Updates the filtered employees by setting IsActive to true and updating the Modified date.
2. Query for Sid NOT IN bankerSids (Update Active to Inactive):
This query updates employees whose Sid is not found in bankerSids and are currently active (IsActive == true).

csharp
Copy code
await IDBContext.Employees
    .GroupJoin(bankerSids, 
        emp => emp.Sid.ToLower(), 
        sid => sid.ToLower(),
        (emp, sidGroup) => new { emp, sidGroup })
    .SelectMany(joined => joined.sidGroup.DefaultIfEmpty(), 
        (joined, sid) => new { joined.emp, sid })
    .Where(result => result.sid == null && result.emp.IsActive == true)
    .Select(result => result.emp)
    .ExecuteUpdateAsync(setters => setters
        .SetProperty(emp => emp.IsActive, emp => false)  // Update IsActive to false
        .SetProperty(emp => emp.Modified, date)          // Update Modified date
    );
Explanation:
GroupJoin(): Performs a left join between Employees and bankerSids. Employees whose Sid is not found in bankerSids will have null in the sidGroup.
SelectMany(): Flattens the result, allowing access to the employee and the sid (which will be null if the Sid is not in bankerSids).
Where(): Filters employees whose Sid is not in bankerSids (sid == null) and are currently active (IsActive == true).
ExecuteUpdateAsync(): Updates these employees by setting IsActive to false and updating the Modified date.
Summary:
First query: Uses join to update employees whose Sid exists in bankerSids.
Second query: Uses GroupJoin (left join) to update employees whose Sid does not exist in bankerSids.
